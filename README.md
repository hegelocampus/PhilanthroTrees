# PhilanthroTrees
### Background and Overview

PhilanthroTrees is a community-based volunteer task tracker that is inspired by Habitica. It is designed to encourage good service habits with a plant based reward and punishment motivation system. Each user's progress is represented with a tree which is grown through completing tasks and gaining experience. To hold users accountable, plant health can also be lost if tasks are not completed frequently enough, which might lead to a loss in progress. Group managers can also assign tasks to grow other plants in a Community Garden -- a visual representation of the group's volunteer progress.

### Inspiration:
[Habitica](https://habitica.com/user/settings/site)
### Twist:
- Plant based Volunteer/Org task tracker
### MVP List:
#### Tasks:
- Tasks generated by group leader
- Any member of the group can complete the tasks
### Experience
- Leveling up makes plant bigger

### Technologies and Technical Challenges:
PhilanthroTrees will be a mobile first-focus web app. Communities, Citizens and their volunteer statistics will be stored via the MongoDB cloud database API.

#### Backend:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/)
#### Frontend: 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [SCSS/SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)

### Database setup:
Each Citizen will belong to a Community, and a Community will have
one Chief

Community will have
- Chief
- Projects with tasks
- Citizens

Citizens will have
- Chief status marker (if applicable)
- Status Attributes
- Completed Tasks (for a Project)

Technical Challenges
- Sprite animation for Citizen and Community leveling
